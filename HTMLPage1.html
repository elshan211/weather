        <b><b>Lyrics</b></b>
        <b>
            I dream in phosphorescence
            Bleed through spaces
            See you drifting past the fog
            But no one told you where to go

            We dive through crystal waters, perfect oceans
            But no one told me not to breathe
            And now the weightlessness recedes

            My, my, those eyes like fire
            I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
            Come now, bite through these wires
            I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
            Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
            Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

            I will travel far beyond the path of reason
            Take me back to Eden, take me back to Eden
            Take me back to Eden

            Well yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
            Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and makeup
            Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
            Room feels like a meat freezer, I dangle in it like cold cuts
            Missed calls, answered phones from people I just don't trust
            Mirror talk, fake love
            But I'll take a pound of your flesh
            Before you take a piece of my paystub
            White roses, black doves, Godmother, rise up
            I need you to see me for what I have become

            My, my, those eyes like fire
            I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
            Come now, bite through these wires
            I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
            Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
            Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

            I guess it goes to show, does it not?
            That we've no idea what we've got until we lose it
            And no amount of love will keep it around
            If we don't choose it
            And I don't know what's got its teeth in me
            But I'm about to bite back in anger
            No amount of self-sought fury
            Will bring back the glory of innocence

            My, my, those eyes like fire
            I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
            Come now, bite through these wires
            I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
            Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
            Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

            I have traveled far beyond the path of reason
            Take me back to Eden
            Take me back to Eden
